### TOPICS

1.	Hibbard deletion of BST
      According to the course lecture notes, after several (Hibbard) deletions have been made, the average height of the tree is √𝑛. Do you agree with this? How does it look after modifying the deletion process to either (a) randomly choose which direction to look for the node to be deleted or (b) choose the direction according to the size of the candidate nodes.
2.	Quicksort
      Do you agree that the number of swaps in “standard” quicksort is 1/6 times the number of comparisons? Is this figure correct? If not, why not. How do you explain it.
3.	2-3 tree
      Implementation of 2-3 Tree. Benchmark various operations of 2-3 Tree like Insert, Search, and depth of the tree and draw comparisons against BST
